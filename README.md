# v2-2566config
# v0-workbench-config

This is the Klipper configuration for my Voron V2.4, V2-2566.

It uses my [common macros](https://github.com/simplisticton/common-macros) too, which are shared with [Workbench](https://github.com/simplisticton/v0-workbench-config), my Voron V0.

Feel free to use anything you find here, but remember, if it breaks, you get to keep the pieces.
